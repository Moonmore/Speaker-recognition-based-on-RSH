 # Speaker-recognition-based-on-RSH
speaker verification of different voice ways

This document is intended to introduce the system and data of the paper. Three speaker recognition systems are respectively under the corresponding files

1.GMM system
	GMM model based on Alize platform

2.X-vector
	The X-vector neural network model has a Readme file on the Kaldi platform 
	and the corresponding file, which shows how our Kaldi experiment.
  
In addition to the three model introductions, we have also published our database on the Zenodo , the detailed address is: https://zenodo.org/record/3816618 Data description in the data folder.
